    "# Project 1: Ranked-choice voting [40 marks]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write Python functions to tally election results from a set of ballots submitted by voters, using different vote counting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write all your code as function definitions, in one of 4 modules: `ballot_data.py`, `pos.py`, `irv.py`, and `stv.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each module should **only contain function definitions, and any required `import` statements** (for example if you need to import `numpy` to use in your function definitions).\n",
    "- For each question, a few simple **automatic tests** will be provided in the notebook. You can use these to start checking that your function works as expected. They work similarly to your Coderunner quizzes.\n",
    "    - In some cases, the tests use `assert` statements (or similar functions from [`np.testing`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html)).\n",
    "        - `assert X` will do nothing if `X` is `True`.\n",
    "        - `assert X` will produce an `AssertionError` if `X` is `False`.\n",
    "    - Some of the tests use helper functions to keep the notebook tidy, which you can see in `notebook_tests.py`.\n",
    "    - The provided tests are minimal (similar to the \"Examples\" provided for pre-checking in the Coderunner quizzes). To make sure that your function works fully with all possible inputs, you need to test it yourself more extensively, using tests which consider different scenarios and possible edge cases.\n",
    "    - Some of the tests load a small amount of ballot data from a `.txt` file. You can look at the data itself by looking at the content of the files.\n",
    "    - To mark your assignment after you've submitted it, more automatic tests will be performed which will test your functions further (similar to the further tests in the Coderunner quizzes, which are run when you click \"Check\"). You will not see the results of these tests until the grades and feedback are returned to you. This means, in particular, that *passing all the tests provided in this notebook does not guarantee full marks.*\n",
    "- The tasks in the assignment will ask you to write specific functions.\n",
    "    - Use the function name, input arguments, and output values specified in the question.\n",
    "    - You may wish to write extra functions to break down your code into smaller parts, so that the main function in each task calls your smaller functions instead of having all the code in a single function definition. This may be useful if your functions become too long, or if you find yourself re-using the same piece of code multiple times.\n",
    "    - If you want to do so, you are allowed to add extra input arguments to the required functions. However, if you do, make sure to give them a default value, so that calling the function without specifying the extra input arguments still gives the expected result as described in the question. In other words, your code should still work exactly as described in the questions, without the need to provide extra information to your functions.\n",
    "- All the functions which manipulate NumPy arrays can be written using loops. However, in some cases, it will be possible to write more efficient functions by making use of vectorised operations (i.e. doing computations on an entire row, column, or whole array all at once, without going over every element of the array one by one).\n",
    "    - For full marks, your functions should avoid the use of loops if a more efficient implementation is possible with Numpy array operations.\n",
    "    - Partial marks can still be achieved even if you use loops for everything. If you are struggling with writing a function, it may be easier to start with using loops, make sure your function gives the correct result, and only later think about whether you can make your code more efficient.\n",
    "    - You will likely find many useful functions in the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html) and the [NumPy user guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) to manipulate or do computations on NumPy arrays in an efficient way.\n",
    "- **Up to half** of the marks for a given question may be deducted for poor readability; missing, incomplete, or inaccurate code comments and/or docstrings; poor code structure and efficiency; or poorly displayed results. You can use the marking scheme for the code reviews for reference to make sure you submit good-quality code. Note that you are **not** required to check input argument values in this assignment."

    "## Ranked-choice voting\n",
    "\n",
    "To experiment with different vote counting systems, we first need some ballots to count. In all cases for this project, a number of voters have been asked to fill their ballots by **ranking their favourite candidates in order of preference**; this is called _ranked-choice voting_. Ranked choice voting is used in Scotland, to elect local council representatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with 5 candidates, one filled ballot might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/ballot.png\" width=\"250px\" alt=\"Filled ballot example\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This voter has selected Candidate 3 as their favourite candidate, and ranked them as first preference. They then ranked Candidate 5 as their second preference, and Candidate 2 as their third preference. They chose not to rank any other candidate -- presumably they really dislike Candidates 1 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "All ballots must have **at least one candidate ranked** as first preference to be valid, but each voter can choose to rank anywhere between 1 and all candidates, in order of preference. The voter in the example above chose to rank 3 candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Different vote counting methods can be used to process the ballot data in different ways, which will lead to different results -- this depends largely on how second, third, etc. preferences are taken into account. This project will explore two different methods to calculate a winner based on ranked-choice ballots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positional voting**, where the rank given to each candidate on the ballot is worth a certain weight, or a certain number of points (this is equivalent). Normally, higher-ranked preference votes are given more weight than lower-ranked preferences.\n",
    "- **Instant runoff voting**, where the candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated one-by-one. At each elimination, ballots which placed the eliminated candidate first are transferred to the candidates that were ranked as second preferences. This allows voters to vote for their favourite candidate, and to rank less preferred candidates in second, third, etc. preferences so that their vote doesn't go to waste if their favourite doesn't win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ballot data representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to represent the ballot data using a rectangular NumPy array of integers, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each **row** represents **one ballot** submitted by one voter;\n",
    "- each **non-zero value** represents a **candidate**;\n",
    "- each **column** represents **a preference rank**, from first to last preference going left to right, for example a `2` in the first column means that Candidate 2 was the voter's first preference;\n",
    "- a value of `0` indicates no ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array will always have as many rows as there are valid ballots (or voters), and as many columns as there are candidates running in the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, all the ballots for an election with 5 candidates and 10 voters might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 0 0 0 0]\n",
    " [4 2 1 0 0]\n",
    " [2 4 5 0 0]\n",

    " [5 4 3 1 2]\n",
    " [3 5 2 0 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- row 0 showing `[1 0 0 0 0]` means that the first voter has ranked Candidate 1 as their first preference, and chosen not to rank any other candidates;\n",
    "- row 1 showing `[4 2 1 0 0]` means that the second voter has ranked Candidate 4 as their first preference, Candidate 2 as their second preference, and Candidate 1 as their third preference, but did not indicate a fourth or fifth preference;\n",
    "- the last row showing `[3 5 2 0 0]` is the ballot shown in the picture above;\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_ballots()` is provided in `ballot_data.py` to generate randomised ballots for a given number of voters and candidates, and a target distribution of probabilities for each candidate to be ranked as a particular preference. You should not modify it -- it's provided for your information, and you should feel free to use it to generate randomised datasets for testing your functions throughout the assignment."

    "Finally, here is a more challenging problem. The **single transferable vote** system, or STV, can be seen as an extension to IRV, in the case where there are multiple seats to fill (instead of a single candidate to elect). For instance, Scottish council elections use this system to elect councillors. [This is a great explainer](https://ballotbox.scot/councils/stv-explained/), with an example from Glasgow from the 2017 local elections -- you can refer to this for a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of votes transferring between candidates according to second preferences is broadly the same as in IRV. The key difference is that there are 2 possible situations where votes can be transferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a candidate is eliminated, their second preference votes are fully transferred to the other candidates (exactly as in IRV).\n",
    "- When a candidate is _elected_, their **surplus** second preference votes are also transferred to the other candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of eliminating candidates until we are left with just one, we need to first check, at every round, whether any candidates are **elected**. A candidate is elected if they have at least a required quota of first-preference votes. This quota is calculated as:\n",

    "For example, if the quota is 100 first-preference votes to get elected, and a candidate got 125 first-preference votes, then they have 25 surplus votes to be redistributed to their second preferences. So we look at all the second preference votes on those 125 ballots, but we redistribute each of these second-preference votes as $\\frac{25}{125} = 0.2$ of a vote instead. Note that this means that we end up with fractional vote counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When no candidates currently have enough votes to go over the quota, we go back to eliminating the least popular candidate, following the same procedure as for IRV. This time, their second-preference votes are redistributed with a weight of 1 to the other candidates (as in IRV).\n",
